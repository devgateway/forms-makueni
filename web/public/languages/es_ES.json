  "crd:corruptionType:FRAUD:introduction": "Fraud is “Any act or omission, including a misrepresentation, that knowingly or recklessly misleads, or attempts to mislead, a party to obtain a financial or other benefit or to avoid an obligation,\" according to the International Financial Institutions (IFI) <a href=\"https://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDOII/Resources/FinalIFITaskForceFramework&Gdlines.pdf\">Anti-Corruption Task Force Guidelines.</a> Suppliers may engage in a variety of fraudulent activities in attempt to increase their chances at winning contracts or in demonstration of progress in implementation. Some of these fraud schemes include: false invoicing, false bidding, product substitution, fictitious contracting, and shadow bidding. The flags represented in each tile below indicate the possible existance of fraud in a procurement process. To learn more about each flag, click on the associated tile.",

  "crd:corruptionType:RIGGING:introduction": "\"Process rigging\" refers to an effort to rig the bidding, awarding, contracting or implementation process in favor of a particular player or entity to the exclusion of other legitimate participants. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, this form of risk implies the possible that a government official intervenes in the process to the benefit of one or more participants. Specific forms of process rigging may include: information withholding or misinformation, rigged specifications, unjustified direct (sole source) contracting, split purchasing, bid manipulation, favoring/excluding qualified bidders, change order abuse, and contracting abuse.",

It could also suggest that the bid has been rigged to favor one bidder or exclude others, including by withholding necessary information or misinforming some bidders.
