About the data:
The data in this portal covers the Government of Makueni County procurement and contracting data. Publication of this data is aimed to help the Government of Makueni County and citizens to monitor procurement efficiency, market competitiveness, and corruption risk, among other use cases. The portal also seeks to foster collaboration that strengthens the capacity of the county government and Makueni citizens to engage with procurement data, and creates an enabling environment for procurement to deliver more effectively for citizens. The data is modelled according to the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) (http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/).
